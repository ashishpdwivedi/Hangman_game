# Hangman_game
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of: ✔ Logic building ✔ User input handling ✔ Game flow design ✔ Error handling &amp; validations  Building this game was a great learning experience and motivated me to work on more interactive projects.  I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions to improve it further!
